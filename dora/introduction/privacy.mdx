Dora is built with privacy in mind from the ground up. Here's some ways Dora keeps your information private:

### Path Cloaking
* Dora cloaks the paths to your files and folders so LLM providers can't see your hostname or how your directory is structured.

### File Content
* File content is not uploaded to models unless you specifically mention files in the chat.

### Data Retention
* Once your file system is indexed, Dora does not keep any of your index information in the servers. It is immediately deleted.
* Your index file is kept local in your local file system.
