Dora is the AI file explorer. Using vector embedding, fast language models and efficient indexing, Dora is able to find your files and folders using semantic search.
Semantic search means you can find files and folders using natural language instead of exact keywords.

Dora scans your file system using a "target directory" as a starting point.
Dora cannot see any files outside of the "target directory" you defined.
Using vector embeddings, Dora saves the metadata for each file and folder you have so you can easily retrieve it at any point.
