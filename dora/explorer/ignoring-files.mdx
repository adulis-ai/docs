title: Ignoring Files
---

On this page, you will learn how to exclude files and folders from indexing.
There are two ways to ignore items from indexing. By going to the settings window or simply right-clicking on the item you want to ignore.
Ignored files and folders will be hidden from the Explorer views and won't be indexed by Dora.

## Settings Option
You can ignore files and folders by going to your settings window.
The settings window is located on the top right corer of Dora.
Clicking the <Icon icon="sliders" iconType="solid" />"Options" item on the floater will open your Settings window.

There are already names of files and folders already added by default to prevent unnecessary indexing.
To add to them, simply add the name of the files and folders you want to ignore and click "Save".

## Explorer Option
You can also ignore files and folders by right-clicking on them on the Explorer section of Dora.
